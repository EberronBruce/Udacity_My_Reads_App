# My Reads App for Udacity React class

This is a simple React app that allows a user to put a book in different categories from Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read shelves.
The user can do a search for books which would call a web api to download data and display them the user then can use the arrow button on the books to select which shelf to move them to.
This can be done on both the shelf and the search fields. The search fields will only accept a limited words based on the api.
The search terms can be found here [Search Terms](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter/blob/master/SEARCH_TERMS.md).

This project was created using Create React App. I will leave those instructions below.
You should be able to use 'npm install' to install the packages and use either 'npm start' or 'yarn start' to run the application.
It should be on your localhost:3000 like the what the instructions say below.

This below is the documentation that comes from Create React App.
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
